## Pitches
In Western music, there are twelve pitches. The easiest way to visualize this is by looking at a keyboard. On a keyboard, moving to the right results in higher pitches and moving to the left results in lower pitches.

The first pitch you should learn to identify is "C". On a keyboard, there are white notes and black notes. The black notes alternate between sets of two and three. The white key immediately to the left of any set of two black keys is C.

Starting at C, the white notes in ascending order (moving to the right) are named C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. The black notes are named by their relationship to their adjacent white notes. For instance, the black note immediately to the right of C can be called C# (C sharp). Alternatively, the same pitch can be called Db (D flat) because it is immediately to the left of D.

White notes can also be named in terms of sharps or flats. For instance, in some circumstances, you might call E "Fb", or you might call F "E#". Whether a particular note is "sharp", "flat", or "natural" depends on context, and can be useful when thinking about a particular [scale](#scales). However, you will get varying opinions on the importance of "correctly" naming notes. The important takeaway is that the same pitch can have multiple different names, and you should be able to find a note regardless of what it is called.

<a name="intervals"></a>
## Intervals
An interval is the distance between two pitches. Intervals, like pitches, can have multiple different names. The first interval to learn is a "half step", which is the smallest possible interval on a keyboard. From any note, the note a half step above it is the note immediately to the right. The note a half step below would be the note immediately to the left.

Example: C# is a half step above C. B is a half step below C. F#/Gb is a half step above F and a half step below G.

Here is a table of the names of all intervals based on the number of half steps between the notes. The last column is the note required to form that interval with C as the lowest note:

| # half steps | interval names | note above C |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 0 | perfect unison | C |
| 1 | half step / minor second | C#/Db |
| 2 | whole step / major second | D |
| 3 | minor third | D#/Eb |
| 4 | major third | E |
| 5 | perfect fourth | F |
| 6 | tritone / augmented fourth / diminished fifth | F#/Gb |
| 7 | perfect fifth | G |
| 8 | minor sixth / augmented fifth | G#/Ab |
| 9 | major sixth | A |
| 10 | minor seventh / dominant seventh | A#/Bb |
| 11 | major seventh | B |
| 12 | perfect octave | C |

There are names for larger intervals, but we won't get into them here.

Each interval has a distinct sound. A major third will sound like a major third regardless of whether it is a C and an E or a G and a B. The pitches are different but the interval is the same. Check out the [ear training section](#ear-training) for information about how to learn how to identify intervals by ear.

A perfect octave is the distance between any pitch and the first instance of the same pitch up or down on the keyboard. On an 88 key piano, the lowest C is named C1, where 1 is the number of the octave. The octave number increases as you ascend the piano all the way to C8.

"Middle C" is an important reference point, and is defined by C4.

<a name="scales"></a>
## Scales
A scale is a set of notes ordered by pitch. There are lots of different types of scales and we will only cover some of them here. Specific scales are denoted by their first pitch (e.g. C, G) and type (e.g. major, minor, blues). The first pitch is also known as the "tonic" or "first degree".

Types of scales are distinguished by the intervals between their notes starting at the tonic. In the table below, the intervals are defined for several types of scales. Starting with any note as the tonic, you can ascend the scale step by step using the intervals to play that scale.

"Degrees" are a useful way to define the notes of a scale as they are related to the tonic. The degrees of a major scale are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Think of the major scale as the "default" scale.

Here's an example of how degrees can be useful: Let's say you know the C major scale. You know the C major scale consists of degrees 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, or C, D, E, F, G, A, and B. You want to learn how to play C minor (natural), but don't know the intervals between the notes in a minor scale off the top of your head. What you do know, however, are the degrees of a natural minor scale: 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7. This means you can take C major, flat the third, sixth, and seventh, and now you have C natural minor: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb. The exact same process can be used to find the natural minor scale of any tonic, as long as you know the major scale in every key.

W denotes a whole step and H denotes a half step.

| type | intervals | degrees | with tonic C |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| major |	W, W, H, W, W, W, H | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 | C, D, E, F, G, A, B |
| natural minor | W, H, W, W, H, W, W | 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, b7 | C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb |
| harmonic minor | W, H, W, W, H, 3H, H | 1, 2, b3, 4, 5, b6, 7 | C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B |
| major pentatonic | W, W, 3H, W, 3H | 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 | C, D, E, G, A |
| minor pentatonic | 3H, W, W, 3H, W | 1, b3, 4, 5, b7 | C, Eb, F, G, Bb |
| blues | 3H, W, H, H, 3H, W | 1, b3, 4, b5, 5, b7 | C, Eb, F, Gb, G, Bb |

Notes about the table above:
* If you hear "minor scale" and "harmonic" or "melodic" is not specified, it's probably referring to the natural minor scale. But don't quote me on that; it's just my own personal experience and I'm mostly self taught.
* I omitted the melodic minor scale above because I don't feel like covering it. Fight me.
* The natural minor scale is the same pattern as the major scale shifted three half steps to the right. In other words, you can move three half steps (a minor third) down from the tonic in a major scale, play the same notes in the original major scale but starting at the new note, and you've played the natural minor scale. The minor scale that contains the same notes as a particular major scale is known as its "relative minor". For instance, playing all the white notes starting at C is the C major scale. A minor third down from C is A, so playing all the white notes starting at A is the A natural minor scale. The A minor scale is the relative minor of C major, and C major is the relative major of A minor.
* The same thing applies with the major and minor pentatonic scales, just with a different pattern.

One of the first exercises I would recommend is playing every major scale. Play C major up and down one octave. Then move up a half step and play C# major. Then D major, D# major, F major, etc...

## Rhythm

<a name="chords"></a>
## Chords
A chord is a basically a set of multiple pitches played simultaneously (usually pitches that sound nice together). This definition isn't perfect, but it will be sufficient for now.

<a name="triads"></a>
### Triads
A triad is a type of chord made up of three notes. There are four main types of triads: major, minor, diminished, and augmented, but major and minor are by far the most common.

Triads can be thought of in terms of degrees, which are defined in the [scales section](#scales). They can also be thought of as thirds stacked on top of each other starting at the chord's root note.

| type | degrees | lower third | upper third | with root C |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| major | 1, 3, 5 | major | minor | C, E, G |
| minor | 1, b3, 5 | minor | major | C, Eb, G |
| diminished | 1, b3, b5 | minor | minor | C, Eb, Gb |
| augmented | 1, 3, #5 | major | major | C, E, G# |

<a name="sevenths"></a>
### Seventh Chords
Seventh chords are triads with an extra note, a seventh, added on top. Seventh chords are very common in jazz.

| type | degrees | lower third | middle third | upper third | with root C |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| major 7 | 1, 3, 5, 7 | major | minor | major | C, E, G, B |
| dominant 7 | 1, 3, 5, b7 | major | minor | minor | C, E, G, Bb |
| minor 7 | 1, b3, 5, b7 | minor | major | minor | C, Eb, G, Bb |
| half diminished | 1, b3, b5, b7 | minor | minor | major | C, Eb, Gb, Bb |
| fully diminished | 1, b3, b5, bb7 | minor | minor | minor | C, Eb, Gb, A |

Notes:
* A half diminished chord is also known as a "minor 7 flat 5 chord".
* If you see a seventh chord with no other indicators of type (e.g. G7), it is a dominant seventh chord.

<a name="inversions"></a>
### Inversions
Chords do not have to be played with their notes in the order defined above. By reordering the notes that make up a chord, you can play different "inversions" of that chord. The chord won't sound exactly the same, but its [function](#functional) will be the same. This means when playing a chord progression, you can use inversions to more smoothly transition from one chord to another. Not only is it easier to play this way (in terms of hand movement), but it also sounds a lot better than playing every chord in root position.

**For triads:**

| type | lowest note | middle note | highest note |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| root position | root | third | fifth |
| first inversion | third | fifth | root |
| second inversion | fifth | root | third |

**For seventh chords:**

| type | lowest note | second note | third note | highest note |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| root position | root | third | fifth | seventh |
| first inversion | third | fifth | seventh | root |
| second inversion | fifth | seventh | root | third |
| third inversion | seventh | root | third | fifth |

<a name="voicings"></a>
### Voicings
Voicing a chord refers to the notes selected for playing a particular chord, the intervals between them, and their order. Inversions, discussed above, are one component of chord voicing. It is really up to you how to voice your chords, and there are a million ways to choose from, but here are some random notes to help:
* You can use "open" or "closed" voicings. With closed voicings, all the notes in the chord fit within an octave. Open voicings take up more than an octave. An example of a closed voicing would be a basic C major chord in root position or any of its inversions (CEG, EGC, GCE). An example of an open voicing for C major would be taking the third and moving it above the fifth (CGE). Open voicings are useful for lower registers, since small intervals will begin to sound muddy the lower pitch gets.
* There is nothing preventing you from playing more notes in your chord voicing. One way I'll voice chords on piano is by using a closed three or four note voicing with my right hand in the middle register, and an open three note voicing in my left hand, usually with the root doubled and the fifth in between.
* The only two notes that differ across major seventh, minor seventh, and dominant seventh chords are the thirds and the sevenths. These are the two notes that give each chord its particular feeling. So a good way to voice seventh chords is to play the root note in the bass, and the third and seventh above. There is no need to include the fifth, since it does not play a large role in giving a seventh chord its character. One exception to this is when the fifth is not a perfect fifth, as is the case in half or fully diminished seventh chords. For these chords, the fifth is important since it makes the chord sound diminished.
* If you are playing with others, and a bass player is playing the root note, there is no need to include the root note in your voicing. It can allow you to get more creative.
* If a particular pitch isn't strictly in a chord, that doesn't mean you can't use it in your voicing. Including other pitches can bring a lot of color to an otherwise boring chord. Adding second or ninth to your voicing is a really simple example of this. For the chord C major, one such voicing is C in the bass, and DEG above. D is not in the C major chord, but it sounds nice, especially when you've already heard the basic voicings of C major a million times.
